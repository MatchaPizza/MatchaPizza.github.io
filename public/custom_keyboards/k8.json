  "description": "This is my first \"custom keyboard\" as it came pre-built. Since the bottom case sounded pretty hollow, I filled it with some leftover foams from the box to dampen the sound a little bit. With the slient tactile switches and compatibility with mac, windows, linux systems, the board is pretty good for office use.",
